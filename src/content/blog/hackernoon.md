I was recently approved as an author for Hackernoon! I plan to [write about cybersecurity and server certificates](https://hackernoon.com/about/toddhgardner) there. My first article was already published about [Netflix's participation in the CA/Browser](https://hackernoon.com/why-netflix-joined-the-certificate-wars-and-why-it-matters) forum and their advocacy of 47 day certificates.
